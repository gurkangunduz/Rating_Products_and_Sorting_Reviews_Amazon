# Rating Product & Sorting Reviews in Amazon
## Business Problem
The accurate computation of the points awarded to the items after sales is one of the most significant issues in e-commerce. Greater customer happiness for the e-commerce site, product prominence for the sellers, and a streamlined shopping experience for the buyers are the key components of the solution to this issue. The proper arranging of the remarks made on the goods is another issue. Misleading remarks will result in both financial loss and a loss of consumers since they will immediately impact the sale of the goods. When these two fundamental issues are resolved, sales on e-commerce sites and among vendors will rise, and customers' shopping experiences will be trouble-free.
